## The assignment is to build a **React Redux Blog**.

   The application is a blog

## Requirements
    
### Description
       
    * The app should be simple blog with ability to view, create and destroy posts functionality. We are not going to focus on styling very much in this app. However it should look nice so Bootstrap  or Material Design can be used here. 
    * The first screen (post_index) shows a list of all our different blog posts that the user currently has. If they click on a blog post it should navigation to show page (post_show). 
    * The user can create a new post by clicking on Add Post button on the index screen which should take them to create new post page (post_new). The user can enter a title, categories and content for a blog post. Once they click on Save button it will save a record in a backend server (posts_api) and it will navigate them back to the index page. They can also click a Cancel button to go back to the index page without saving anything.
    * Note that the pages should have a route so user can go directly to a page.
